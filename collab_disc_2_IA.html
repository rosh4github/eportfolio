										</h3>
									
										<p> Linguistically speaking, every language needs definitions in syntax, semantics, and pragmatics - and having a common framework of the above elements is greatly advantageous for communication between agents (that may otherwise carry diverse native languages). Given that there are no universal languages in place to represent information/queries, the following Agent Communication Language (ACL) was created to address this communication barrier (Finin, 1994).
										</p>		
										<p>	Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) aids in the intelligence of the intelligent agents (IA) by providing them with an expressive common communication language, that in turn supports their ability to act autonomously while working together in cooperation with other IAs to meet goals of varying complexity (Finin, 1994). 
										</p>	
										<p>There are far more advantages of ACLs than there are disadvantages, let’s look at this with respect to content. Suppose a commitment to a content language is made for a system. This is advantageous as there is more syntax sharing between the agents and therefore more content can be carried, but the disadvantage is that all applications are then bound to use that same language (which can prove to be a constraint later on) (Finin, 1995). Let’s look at another perspective which is advantageous. 
										</p>	
										<p>Agents using ACLs work within the framework of Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) via speech acts (such as informing, requesting, etc.) to communicate with other agents, to further their goals, or to achieve them) (Shoham, n.d.). Agent 1 can act in a manner that brings Agent 2 to act in a way Agent 1 so desires. This can be compared to how objects would work within the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) wherein Object 1 makes the decision to invoke the method of Object 2 (in a programming language such as Python or Java) to perform some action. This leaves all decision making to Object 1 (Nebel et al., 2018).
										</p>
										<p>The merit of ACLs therefore reflects in the way communal goals are achieved for agents.
