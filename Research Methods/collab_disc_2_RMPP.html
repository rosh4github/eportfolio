										<p>Let’s look at each ethical concern individually:
										</p>
										<hr>		
										<p>1. Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?
										</p>
										<p>I don’t believe it is unethical to provide two different conclusions as long as the correct data is used, which maintains his professional integrity and accountability according to Principle A, and responsibility to the profession according to Principle F of the Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice (American Statistical Association, 2022). 
										</p>
										<p>How those conclusions are supported and the statistician’s personal objectivity in defending a certain conclusion be utilized is where Abi can act ethically, in line with Principle D (American Statistical Association, 2022).</p>
										<hr>
										<p>2. Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
										</p>
										<p>According to the Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice, Principle C: Responsibilities to Stakeholders, Abi as an ethical statistical professional has a responsibility to his project stakeholders (American Statistical Association, 2022). One would argue that it is the manufacturer that is the stakeholder; I would add that even the consumers that would eventually bring Whizzz cereal into their homes and in their diet are a primary stakeholder in this situation.
											At the moment, Abi’s collected data and analyses only presents the negative analyses. If he were to do other correlations, they may produce positive analyses. If so, I believe Abi is obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses back to the manufacturer. However, he should additionally explain to the stakeholder herein of the potential limitations and adverse events that could follow introducing this product into the market, not to mention the legal ramifications - should this harm an individual’s health. This approach also maintains scientific integrity, especially when there are conflicting interests.
											</p>
											<hr>
										<p>3. Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results? </p>
										<p>Yes, in line with Principle A (American Statistical Association, 2022). </p>
										<hr>
										<p>4. If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</p>
										<p>This is a classic example of disparate impact, outlined as unlawful in the Civil Rights Act, wherein inadvertent harm can be caused to individuals/group of people even when the intentions were good (Cote, 2021). Even though Abi’s intentions were good in putting forth both sets of results to the manufacturer, his prediction may be right in assuming the manufacturer may publicize only the positive ones.  </p>
										<p>The other course of action that Abi has herein is to report an inconclusive outcome. This may just be true, should he conduct further analyses and see significant results of both positive and negative nature (from a social standpoint). This may garner the manufacturer to invite more statisticians to reach an agreement on the best conclusion, or consider altering the nutritional value of the cereal altogether.</p>
