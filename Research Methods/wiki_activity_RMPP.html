										<p>A study was primarily conducted to find out why people listen to music, by examining music preferences. A focus on when, where, how, and why people listen to music was to be given in the study results to form a theory around it. 
										</p>
										<p>A questionnaire (given above) was given to participants as part of the leisure/lifestyle preferences study, specifically to understand their attitudes and/or beliefs about different leisure/lifestyle activities.
										</p>
										<p>The participants were asked to use a scale (ranging from 0 - strongly disagree, to 100 - strongly agree) for questions 1-3:
										</p>
										<p>Question 1 was included to understand the importance that individuals give to leisure and/or various lifestyle activities. Question 2 was included to understand subject beliefs about how much these lifestyle activities say about their self-views. Question 3 was included to understand how the subjects perceive their own personalities (and that of others) based on their leisurely choices.
										</p>
										<p>Question 4 used a scale from 1 (Never) to 7 (All the time). This question was included to understand how the subjects engaged in various lifestyle activities and with what frequency.
										</p>
										<p>I believe the form of the four questions was appropriate as they are closed questions that agree with what the researcher wants to find out. It was not leading (even though the researcher was interested in the music preferences, the questionnaire was open to lifestyle preferences in general).
										</p>
										<p>I’d like to share some thoughts on the questionnaire design. I believe that all questions address the aims of the research. The questionnaire was short and precise. There was a logical progression to the questions. While it did not progress from the general to the specific, it was all pertaining to the context. Lastly, the questions were independent of each other (i.e. the answer of a question was not influenced by previous queries) (McLeod, 2018)</p>
										<p>Most importantly - none of the questions suffered from the seven deadly survey questions (Barrett, 2020).</p>
