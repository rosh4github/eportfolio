										<p> Cambridge Analytica (a voter profiling company) secured a $15 million funding from a republican donor at the time in the promise of providing tools to identify personalities of American voters and to potentially influence their behavior accordingly. However, the tools were in vain without data to support them. Therefore, Cambridge Analytica (illegitimately for the most part as only 0.009% consented to sharing their data) harvested information private to approximately 50 million users from their Facebook profiles, 30 million of which helped political campaigns at the time. The aim of this personality profiling, so to speak, was to rewire USA’s political arena and to shift the culture accordingly. The company in question here also faced investigations in Britain for their alleged illegal work on the Brexit campaign (Rosenberg et al., 2018).
										</p>		
										<p>	The “how” of the situation is clearly rooted in psychology. General analytic firms at the time were leaning towards legitimately available records (by reviewing prior voting records, consumer purchases etc.) to predict voter behavior and/or political beliefs. The firm needed a more specific solution, which they found at the Psychometrics Centre at Cambridge University, wherein researchers had developed a personality-mapping technique based on a person’s Facebook likes. These researchers provided monetary rewards for people to take a personality quiz. While they refused to work with the firm, this idea was adopted by another psychology professor (Aleksandr Kogan) who designed the questionnaire tool (moreso a psychographic platform) for Cambridge Analytica, and started collecting data. 
										</p>	
										<p>As of May 2014, these questionnaires were able to predict traits such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, life satisfaction, IQ, gender, age, political views (conservative / liberal / uninvolved / libertarian), religion, job, university subject concentration, self-disclosure, fair-mindedness, self-monitoring, belief in star signs, and sensational interests (five factors namely violent occultism, militarism, intellectual activities, credulousness, and wholesome interests - generally used in forensic psychology for understanding criminality). Cambridge Analytica was then able to offer real-time profiling of a particular voter to Republican donors, such as “a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult” to deliver appropriate political messages (Rosenberg et al., 2018).
										</p>
										<p>As of 2016, the firm was helping Cruz’s and Trump’s 2016 election by offering services such as digital ads / fundraising appeals with targeted audiences, voter turnout modeling, TV ads, and suggestions for Trump’s travel to ramp up support (Rosenberg et al., 2018).
										<p>This event, amongst a few others, have now commanded legal protection in today’s world. The above, however, has not helped in the confidence of the American population towards their data privacy, which can be socially and ethically demoralizing (Auxier et al, 2019). Even with the changing data use rules, the ad network is usually very invasive. Signal is a company that tried to reflect exactly this, using available Facebook data (for targeting users) and taking out Facebook ads that were as intrusive as “You got this ad because you’re a newlywed pilates instructor and you’re cartoon crazy. This ad used your location to see you’re in La Jolla”  (Wodinsky, 2021). This is a clear example of the ad industry and social media’s impact against ethical, social, and even professional standpoints.
