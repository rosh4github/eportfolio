										<p>The case study I picked from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) is “Malicious Inputs to Content Filters”. This case study discusses a system (i.e. Blocker Plus), whose main mission statement is to block legally designated harmful (according to the U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act or CIPA) content from children. An update to their regular mechanism to block content was stirred up by the development team, which employed Machine Learning (ML) techniques to be on top of updating their blacklist of harmful content. A review of their system later revealed that the system is flagging content inappropriately (e.g. content regarding gay and/or lesbian marriage and topics not originally covered by CIPA), which was a direct effect of activist groups misusing the feedback loop of the ML technique (Acm.org, 2019).
										</p>		
										<p>Their approach to this issue was to keep the system in the market and block the accounts of said activist groups, which did not exacerbate the problem further but also did not resolve the corrupt nature of the current model. With this approach, there were a number of issues that were not appropriately dealt with, that break the ethics barrier in numerous ways as we will discuss below (Acm.org, 2019). Let’s first review how this system meets some of the ACM Code of Ethics (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). 
										</p>	
										<p>Principle 2.3 seems to be justly met with their original system design. Principle 1.1 is met not only with the main mission statement of Blocker Plus, but also by the approach they decided to take when they realized that their system was corrupt. They decided to keep the system in the market with its fallacies, in line with the ethics code as such, “When the interests of multiple groups conflict, the needs of those less advantaged should be given increased attention and priority” (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). 
										</p>
										<p>Let’s now discuss how this system, and the choices made in business, may not meet some of the ethics code discussed above.  
										<ul>
											<li>Given the nature and complexity of ML processes, and the fact that this technology is still newer (relatively), Principle 2.5 should have been adhered to with proper attention, which causes a moral conflict with the mission statement itself. A deed with a good intention may not always result in a good result, which is why risk analysis and mitigation should have been done. And if intentional misuse cannot be predicted and henceforth avoided, it may be best to not implement the system in the first place, as is detailed in Principle 2.9 (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) .
											<li>In line with Principle 2.8, authorization for feedback into the ML loop would naturally not have been given if the system had not been public, which is also a risk that would’ve been caught in risk analysis (potential misuse by unintended users). It so happened that their lackluster stewardship and decision to keep this system in the market, without making the user aware of its new limitations, violated general professionalism and in particular Principles 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.4, 2.7, and 3.7, by not being able to avoid harm, not being trustworthy / honest to its stakeholders, rejecting professional feedback, and not taking adequate action not to discriminate (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). This discrimination also violated British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct due to Blocker Plus’s professional activities not being conducted towards public interest (British Computer Society, n.d.)</li>
										</ul>

											<p>The initial post about the case study “Malicious Inputs to Content Filters” has indeed resulted in an interesting conversation within this thread (Acm.org, 2019). I highlighted their approaches to issues that came up as part of doing business, and how their practices were in line or out of line in an ethical light, specifically discussing Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). I added on to this ethical debate by bringing in violations of British Computing Society (BCS) Code of Conduct as well (British Computer Society, n.d.). 
											</p>		
											<p>My classmate Claire added on to the conversation very vividly. In my discussion of ACM Principle 2.5, she added on by discussing Principles 3.1 (pertaining to public good) and 1.6 (pertaining to respecting privacy) where the system additionally fell short. In terms of risk management, she added examples of how impact assessment could have been conducted (such as bias analysis, threat modeling, and/or robustness testing of the ML techniques incorporated), to which I agree completely. She was also aligned on my train of thought around not sidestepping accountability on Blocker Plus’s end (Sargent, 2024).
											</p>	
											<p>In conclusion, I believe in a situation as above, Blocker Plus should strongly consider fixing the root cause of the issue (rather than putting a band-aid on it) by auditing the system, engaging stakeholders, and communicating this system flaw with users, to maintain their professionalism and ethical integrity.
