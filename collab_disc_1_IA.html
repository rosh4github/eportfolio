										<p> Agents can be defined as computer systems capable of meeting their design objectives via autonomous action in a certain environment. Some examples of agent models mainly used today include simple agents (albeit not intelligent agents) which are essentially control systems, software daemons, reactive and functional systems. Intelligence, in this regard, comes from the capabilities of an agent with respect to their reactivity, proactiveness (goal-directed behavior), and social ability. Intelligent agents can then be appropriately used for meeting certain design objectives in a timely fashion, while conducting social interaction with humans and/or other agents (if needed), and being reactive to their surroundings as they achieve the objective (Wooldridge, 2009).

											Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), as a sub-discipline of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) research, concerns with strategizing and coordinating the behavior of autonomous intelligent agents (w.r.t. their skills, goals, plans, and knowledge) to execute change in their environment jointly. The motivations of using MAS, initially in the computer science/engineering fields, can be attributed to its variegated semi-autonomous components that applied to distributed areas. In today’s arena, those same autonomous properties are helping agents rise and become vital in contemporary applications (such as e-commerce, information retrieval, etc.) due to their ability to be dynamic components within large-scale information systems, serve and fulfill various goals, and be built in disparate ways (Sikora & Langdon, 2006). 
											
											Agent-based models (in general) are also being used within organizations to solve optimization issues in business and systems analytics, such as scheduling, supply chain, and knapsack problems (Pinder, 2013). There are and will be various applications beyond the above-mentioned, focused on using agent-based modeling (grounded in artificial intelligence) to help agents learn from their experience (just like humans do).
